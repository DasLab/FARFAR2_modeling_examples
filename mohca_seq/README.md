# Running the twister sister ribozyme 5Y87 using the FARFAR2 ROSIE server

We have supplied input files in this directory: the FASTA, the secondary structure file, the native (experimental) PDB structure, and the file of constraints generated from multiplexed OH cleavage analysis (MOHCA). For simulation, upload these files to the corresponding inputs as directed in the text.

# Interpreting the output

Because the actual Rosetta "silent files" -- a complete record of all the structures produced in the trajectory -- would be too large to version with Github, in the output/ directory we include just the top 10 cluster center PDBs generated in this run.
