# Running the BWYV pseudoknot 1L2X using the FARFAR2 ROSIE server

We do not supply individual input files for this example because they won't be necessary! Instead, we have two pieces of text you can type in or copy and paste from here. For the sequence:

```
gcgcggcaccguccgcggaacaaacgg
```

For the secondary structure:

```
.(((((..[[[.))))).......]]]
```

# Interpreting the output

Because the actual Rosetta "silent files" -- a complete record of all the structures produced in the trajectory -- would be too large to version with Github, in the output/ directory we include just the top 10 cluster center PDBs generated in this run.
