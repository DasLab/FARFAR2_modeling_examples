# FARFAR2_modeling_examples
This repository contains inputs for four different worked examples of RNA 3D structure modeling with the FARFAR2 ROSIE server available at https://rosie.rosettacommons.org/farfar2.

We also provide some sample outputs. Since FARFAR2 simulations generate collections of structures through randomly seeded Monte Carlo simulations, their outcomes are not deterministic. Your simulation will by design not reproduce the exact outcomes described here, but the central conclusions highlighted in the paper are robust to choice of random seed.
